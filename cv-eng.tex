\subsection{Current Placement}
\cventry{2023 November -- 2025 November }{Postdoctoral Fellow (``assegno di ricerca'')}%
{Alma Mater Studiorum -- University of Bologna}{Cesena}
{}{Currently appointed as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the COMMONS-WEARS project (funded as a PRIN), focusing on the engineering collective applications in complex, layered environments with multi-mobile edge computing architectures.}
\subsection{Research Profile}
\cvitem{}{
My research sits at the intersection of \emph{collective adaptive systems engineering} (software engineering) and \emph{machine learning} methodologies for distributed system. Particularly, my work contributes to several specific areas:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Software Engineering for Collective Behaviors:} In this research area, I focus on advancing the macroprogramming paradigm (programming systems from a global perspective) in the context of very large distributed systems (e.g., swarm robotics, smart cities). 
  I propose novel solutions for managing groups of robots in a distributed way based on spatial computing principles~\citejournals{aguzzi2023field-sensing}, 
  along with new programming approaches through frameworks like Macroswarm~\citejournals{aguzzi2025macroswarm}. 
  My work includes fundamental research on how to engineer such applications, 
  leading to foundational publications on collective autonomy~\citejournals{casadei2021programming} and comprehensive roadmaps for future development~\cite{casadei2024software}. 
  This research covers several aspects of the programming pipeline, 
  including runtime monitoring for system safety~\citeconferences{aguzzi2024optimising}, 
  programming frameworks like ScaFi~\cite{casadei2022scafi} and Macroswarm~\cite{aguzzi2023macroswarm} and others~\cite{aguzzi2024scafi,aguzzi2021scafi}, 
  novel reactive models for swarm programming~\cite{casadei2023self},
  and the development of novel architectural patterns for collective computation~\cite{aguzzi2022dynamic}.
  \item \textbf{Hybrid Methodologies for Collective Intelligence:} In this research area, building on the advancements from my work on collective behaviors, 
  I integrate machine learning solutions to improve currently manual design approaches. 
  The goal is to both enhance system adaptability (through learning) 
  and improve overall efficiency. 
  This integration was first outlined through comprehensive roadmaps~\cite{aguzzi2022machine,aguzzi2021research}, 
  then implemented in several ways: 
  leveraging Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for program synthesis~\cite{aguzzi2022towards}, 
  improving macroprogramming execution with scheduling learned via MARL~\cite{aguzzi2022addressing}, 
  and enhancing current MARL solutions for swarms by using macroprogramming as a way to represent agent state~\cite{aguzzi2023field}.
  \item \textbf{Advanced Methodologies for Cooperative and Scalable Learning:} 
  Based on the insights gained from programming scalable systems with macroprogramming, 
  I bring these advancements to \emph{cooperative learning}, 
  highlighting the need for scalable solutions. 
  In this regard, 
  I propose novel MARL approaches based on neighborhood policies~\cite{DBLP:conf/sac/MalucelliDAV25} 
  and explore new federated learning solutions that avoid central points of failure~\cite{domini2024field,domini2024proximity} (work that led to a Marie Curie project with an associated Seal of Excellence award).
  In this area, I also proposed novel framework for cooperative many agent deep reinforcement learning in Scala~\cite{domini2023scarlib} and novel simulation pipeline for large-scale systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/dsrt/DominiAPV24}.
  \item \textbf{Generative AI for Modern Applications:} 
  This area represents a natural continuation of my previous work, 
  particularly focusing on how to use generative AI for designing modern distributed applications.
   Initial work explores how to integrate small LLMs in chatbots for healthcare management~\cite{tschope2025novel,magnini2025open}. During this period, I've also supervised several theses on code generation with LLMs for domain-specific languages, 
   with the aim of integrating these advancements with macroprogramming paradigms to further enhance collective system development.
